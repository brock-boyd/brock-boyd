## Hello Fellow Devs :wave:

My name is Brock Boyd. I am currently work as a credit analyst for a bank and have has a long-time aspiration to learn how to code.

I currently have a self-taught background in SQL and am now moving my studies to learn more about Python and other languages. I'm interesting in learning more how I
can apply code to data analysis and maximizing efficiencies in day to day life. 

I'm always looking to learn something new. I'm the kind of person that isn't satisfied knowing the what, I strive to know the why.

Feel free to connect with me on other platforms!
